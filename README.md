# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Repository

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts Repository! This repository serves as a resource for learning and understanding key concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) through examples and explanations.

## Introduction

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a popular programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of "objects," which are instances of classes. OOP enables developers to model real-world entities as objects and define their properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) using classes. Understanding OOP concepts is essential for building modular, maintainable, and scalable software systems.

## Concepts Covered

This repository covers various fundamental OOP concepts, including:

| Concept         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Class           | A blueprint for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have.                                                                                                          |
| Object          | An instance of a class. It represents a specific entity in your program, possessing its own unique state (values for its attributes) and behavior (functions/methods).                                                                          |
| Encapsulation   | Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class). It hides the internal state of objects from outside interference and manipulation, allowing controlled access through defined interfaces (methods).                                 |
| Inheritance     | Inheritance allows a class (subclass/child class) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass/parent class). It facilitates code reuse and promotes the establishment of a hierarchical relationship between classes, where subclasses can extend or override behaviors of the superclass. |
| Polymorphism    | Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass through a shared interface. It enables flexibility and dynamic behavior by allowing methods to be overridden in subclasses, thus exhibiting different behaviors while being invoked through the same interface.      |
| Abstraction     | Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by emphasizing essential features and hiding unnecessary details. In OOP, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces, which define a set of methods without providing implementation details. It allows for defining a contract that concrete subclasses must fulfill.                   |
| Association     | Association represents a relationship between two or more classes where objects of one class are connected to objects of another class through their respective instances. It can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many, indicating the nature and multiplicity of the relationship.                        |
| Composition     | Composition is a form of association where one class (composite) contains an object of another class (component) as a part of its state. The component object cannot exist without the composite object and typically has a strong lifecycle dependency on it.                                                      |
| Aggregation     | Aggregation is another form of association where one class (whole) is composed of one or more objects of another class (parts), but the parts can exist independently of the whole. It represents a "has-a" relationship, where the lifetime of the parts is not tightly coupled with the lifetime of the whole.                      |
